# Skeleton Express App

# Installation

This is not an actual app, but a template to get started with express.

## Dependencies

* node.js

## Tools Setup

After cloning this repo, run the following command in the same directory
as the repo to get npm and grunt set up. If jshint runs, then you have
everything installed and working.

1. `npm install`
2. [sudo] `npm install -g grunt-cli`
3. `npm install grunt`
4. `grunt jshint`

## Project Setup

To create an express app, you will need Routes, Middleware, and Views.
Each of these is added by placing files in the correct locations with
certain structures in them.

### Configuration

Add json files in the `config` directory to set configuration data for your app.

Each directory in `config` should named for an execution environment with the exception of `default`. The execution environment is selected by the environment variable `NODE\_ENV` when the app starts. So when running in `development`, the app will load configuration from the `config/development` directory.

The `config/default` directory is loaded for all environments, and then the environment specific configuration overrides those set in `config/default`. 

### Routes

To set up a route, add a file in the `routes` directory with the following structure:

```javascript
module.exports = function(app) {

	app.get('/', function(req, res) {
		res.render('main', {
			title: 'Skeleton Express App Main Page'
		});
	});

};
```

The routes `index.js` will include that file and call the function as part of its setup sequence.

### Middleware

To include middleware in the app, add files to the `app-uses` directory. Each will follow this pattern:

```javascript
var express = require('express');
var cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');
var bodyParser = require('body-parser');
var morgan = require('morgan');

function use(app, config) {
	app.use(express.static(__dirname + '../static'));
	app.use(morgan(':date[iso] dev'));
	app.use(cookieParser());
	app.use(bodyParser.json());
}

module.exports = use;
```

Each middleware loader exports a function which is called by the `index.js` when we load. Within that function, just call `app.use` with the middleware object. Adding more middleware is as simple as creating another file following this pattern. You can use multiple middlewares in one file if you need to initialize them in order.

### Views

The `views` directory has a different structure. It contains both layouts and partials. Each view in its top level can referenceany number of partials, and is rendered inside a layout.

```
+-- views
	+-- index.hbs
	+-- layouts
	|	+-- single.hbs
	+-- partials
	|	+-- head.hbs
```

In this example, rendering `index.hbs` will use the layout `single.hbs`, which includes the partial `head.hbs`.

This project uses handlebars for its templates, but you can use any engine you like. Just add the middleware for it in the `app-uses` directory. See `app-uses/handlebars.js` as an example.

## Running the Project

To run the project and see the express app in action, use the following command:
```bash
NODE_ENV=development node app.js
```

This command sets `NODE\_ENV` to choose between production and development. See the Configuration section above.

## TODO

These are things I would like to add to this skeleton project. In no particular order.

* Project generator - Express has a generator which creates a basic project. Ideally I would like to be able to npm install this project into another project and run the generator to build the structure.

* Passport and Mongodb - Most apps I can think of to build require user management in some form. I would like to be able to include that in the skeleton.

* Bootstrap and other front-end tools - I intend to extend the Gruntfile and use Bower to install and manage front-end libraries. This would allow just adding the library to bower.json and then running grunt to get started.
